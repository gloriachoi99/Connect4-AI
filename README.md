# Connect4-AI
This was the final project for Harvey Mudd College's CS 5 (Introduction to CS) in Spring 2018.

With the help of the CS5 grutors and Professor Geoff Kuenning, my classmate, Karoline, and I created a Python program that allows a human to play Connect4 with an AI opponent. 

In our Connect 4 game, we decided to take an extra step and delete the bottom row of the board once it 
becomes full. We created two functions to accomplish this task- bottomRowIsFull and deleteBottomRowIfFull. 

When playing our game, we encourage you to use hostGame() within the TetrisBoard class (the modified class with this new rule). This will achieve our desired goal of deleting the bottom row of the board completely once it has been filled, and the corresponding rows will fall into place like gravity! In this repo, I have attached jpg files that show you how to initialize the board using the hostGame() method and the TetrisBoard class. When initializing the board, you must specify the width and height of the board which you wish to play on.

Happy playing!
